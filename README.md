# Song Classification

Demonstration and comparison of classification algorithms performed upon data related with music genres. Given the metrics the algorithms try to label the song as 'Rock' or 'Hip-Hop'.
The procedures implemented as follows:

- Initial exploration of potential correlation between features
- Further normalization for Principle Component Analysis (PCA)
- PCA execution and visualization for feature extraction
- Training of Decision Tree and Logistic Regression. Comparing results
- Model bias improvement and cross-validation evaluation of models
- Comparing results/conclusion
